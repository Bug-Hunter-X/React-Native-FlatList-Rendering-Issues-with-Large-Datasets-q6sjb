The solution to this bug involves correctly implementing the `keyExtractor` prop in the FlatList component and potentially optimizing rendering with `getItemLayout`.  Here's the corrected code:

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={largeDataArray}
  keyExtractor={(item, index) => item.id || index.toString()}
  renderItem={({ item }) => (
    <ItemComponent item={item} />
  )}
  getItemLayout={(data, index) => ({
    length: ITEM_HEIGHT,
    offset: ITEM_HEIGHT * index,
    index,
  })}
/>
```

This ensures that each item has a unique key, preventing rendering issues caused by component recycling.  `getItemLayout` provides performance improvements by telling the FlatList how much space each item occupies.  Ensure that `ITEM_HEIGHT` is appropriately defined. If your `ItemComponent`'s rendering depends on its state, ensure that state changes are managed carefully to avoid unexpected behavior.  If data changes frequently consider using `useMemo` or `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
