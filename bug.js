This React Native bug is related to the usage of the FlatList component with a large number of items. When scrolling through the list, some components may not render correctly or may not update their state properly. This can lead to visual glitches or unexpected behavior.

The problem may be caused by the way FlatList handles component recycling and key generation.  If keys are not properly assigned, or if components are not correctly unmounted, this can lead to incorrect rendering or state management.

Here's an example of a FlatList with the potential problem:

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={largeDataArray}
  renderItem={({ item }) => (
    <ItemComponent item={item} />
  )}
/>
```

If `largeDataArray` is very large, and `ItemComponent`'s state is not properly handled in relation to its key, then this may cause the issue described.
